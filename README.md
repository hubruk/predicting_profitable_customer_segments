# predicting_profitable_customer_segments
Goal:
Marketing campaigns constitute a typical strategy to generate business revenue. Companies use direct marketing
when targeting groups of customers by contacting them to meet a specific business goal. Contacting groups of
customers is, however, an expensive activity. A marketing campaign is deemed successful if it has a good Return on
Investment (ROI).
The goal of this project was to build a data driven model that finds the customer groups that lead to good ROIs.
Task Description:
The company is an online retail company. Over many years, the company ran different marketing
campaigns by targeting in each round two different groups of customers. After each campaign it evaluated the ROI of
both groups to decide which group was the most profitable to target.
Additional questions:
1. What percentage of campaigns led to group 1 being the most profitable? What about group 2? And neither
of the groups?
2. Based on all the information you have, can you build a model to optimize future campaigns? Given the
characteristics of two different groups of customers, please predict which group to target.
3. By how much do you think your model could improve campaign success rates? How would you test that?
4. Can you write an API for your model that the marketing IT team can call?
